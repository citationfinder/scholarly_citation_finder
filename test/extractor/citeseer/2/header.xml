<abstract>Multiple-Phased Systems, whose operational life can be partitioned in a set of disjoint periods, called “phases”, include several classes of systems such as Phased Mission Systems and Scheduled Maintenance Systems. Because of their deployment in critical appli-cations, the dependability modeling and analysis of Multiple-Phased Systems is a task of primary rele-vance. However, the phased behavior makes the analy-sis of Multiple-Phased Systems extremely complex.. This paper is centered on the description and applica-tion of DEEM, a dependability modeling and evalua-tion tool for Multiple Phased Systems. DEEM supports a powerful and efficient methodology for the analytical dependability modeling and evaluation of Multiple</abstract>
