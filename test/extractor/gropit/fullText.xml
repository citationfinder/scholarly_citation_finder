            <abstract>
                <p>Every author and publisher is interested in adding their publications to the widely used bibliographic databases freely accessible in the world wide web: This ensures the visibility of their publications and hence of the published research. However, the inclusion requirements of publications in the bibliographic databases are heterogeneous even on the technical side. This survey paper aims in shedding light on the various data formats, protocols and technical requirements of getting indexed by widely used bibliographic databases in the area of computer science and provides hints for maximal database inclusion. Furthermore, we point out the possibilities to utilize the data of bibliographic databases, and describes some personal and institutional research repository systems with special regard to the support of inclusion in bibliographic databases.

Readers can browse and query these collections of bibliographic databases, which provide links to full text pdfs of articles and/or to articles&apos; pages of the publishers. Hence bibliographic databases are the starting point for literature review done by scientists. Scientists wish their work to be visible (at least) inside (but also outside) their scientific community. For this purpose they meet with each other on workshops and conferences in order to present their work, discuss their ideas and build personal networks. After the event (and also for journal articles) it is very important for a scientist that his or her articles can be found in bibliographic databases such that scientists, which have not participated in the event, notice and consider his or her contributions. This is the precondition that his or her articles are cited and that the scientist reaches higher impact factors: The impact factor of a scientist is often measured by the Hirsch index

Not surprisingly the inclusion in bibliographic databases is one of the most important key factors for the success of young publishers. On the other side bibliographic databases aim to include as many articles as possible, but some focus on already successful publishers due to their limited capacities and resources.</p>

                <head>Some institutional research repositories like PUB 1 at</head>
                <p>Bielefeld University also prepare metadata of their contained publications for bibliographic databases. Authors using these institutional research repositories are independent from the publisher for the inclusion in bibliographic databases. Once they have added their publication information to their institutional research repository , their publications appear in the supported bibliographic databases after the next crawling turn. This ensures a timely inclusion as well as a higher number of bibliographic databases aware of their publications. However, many bibliographic databases only collect data from publishers and not from institutional or even personal research repositories. Related questions immediately arise: • What are widely used and hence important scholarly bibliographic databases for a specific research area like computer science? • Who can add publication information to these bibliographic databases? • How can publication information be added to bibliographic databases? • What data formats and protocols are used for imand export? • How to utilize and automatically process the information provided by bibliographic databases? This review aims to provide the answers to these questions by analyzing • the basic data formats and protocols for data exchange to and from bibliographic databases</p>

                <head n="2.1">BibTeX</head>
                <p>BibTeX was developed by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport for managing and formatting lists of references [65]. It is typically used together with L A T E X documents but can be used with other software and became a de facto standard to define references. The first release was in 1985 and the latest version is from 2010. A BibTeX file consists of a set of entries each of which represent a reference. There are currently 14 common entry types in BibTeX, for example book, article or incollection. Each of this entry type has required fields and some optional fields, where for example title and author are almost always required. Multiple authors should be separated with an and instead of commas. Further information can be found in the format description [29, 30]. Listing 1 presents an exemplary BibTeX entry and Figure 1 the generated output in the References section for this BibTeX entry. The generated output depends on the used citation style. The one shown here corresponds to the style ieeetrans.</p>

                <p>Each entry must have a citation key, which is later used as a reference to this entry within the L A T E X document . This key must be unique within a BibTeX file and is ideally easy recognizable. When the L A T E X document is compiled, BibTeX generates the list of references from the given BibTeX entries using the template for a selected citation style. A BibTeX file is a plain text file that can be edited with any text editor, but there is also software (for example BibDesk 2 , JabRef 3 or Bibfilex 4 ) that can manage whole bibliographies in one big file, offering a graphical user interface, search and sort features and auto-generation of the citation keys following a predefined or user-defined pattern as well as managing associated PDF files or URLs.</p>

                <p>has developed a common system for using metadata to describe web resources at a conference at Dublin/Ohio in the mid 1990s. This system is known as Dublin Core Metadata and was meant to allow the authors of websites to describe their content in a way it could be discovered by keyword-based search engines.</p>

                <p>Nowadays though most of the leading search engines ignore most of the metadata of websites because there was an extensive misuse and spamming with metadata in the past. Practical benefits of the use of metadata remain only in fields where the search engines can trust the data and thus consider it. That is why the Dublin Core Metadata, although originally conceived for all kinds of content, is now primarily used in the library world [72]. But even there Google claims that &quot;they work poorly for journal papers because Dublin Core doesn&apos;t have unambiguous fields for journal title, volume, issue, and page numbers&quot;. 5 Instead, a complete bibliographic citation including for example the journal, volume, issue and page numbers can and is recommended to be given in the bibliographicCitation field [3]. Dublin Core Metadata can be presented in RDF/XML or embedded in the head section of HTML documents in &lt;meta&gt; tags. There are 15 core elements and some more additional elements in Dublin Core. All elements are optional , can be repeated and can be in any order. We refer the interested reader to the format description [23, 24] for more details. Listing 2 shows an exemplary Dublin Core entry.</p>

                <p>PRISM is developed by the PRISM Metadata Initiative and was first released in 2001. The current version is 3.0 from 2012. It specifies an XML/RDF element set for storing and interchanging metadata that describes resources or their relationship to other resources and incorporates Dublin Core elements (see Section 2.2) [37]. Listing 4 contains an example of PRISM meta tags. Although initially developed with the needs of publishers in mind and focused on handling print content like magazines or journals, its newer version is not limited to bibliographic usage but can describe many types of content. PRISM can also define property rights or usage permissions . The official PRISM introduction document [38] contains further information.</p>

                <p>The Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) was developed in 2002 by the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of The United States Library of Congress [83]. The current version is 3.5 from 2013. It is an XML format schema originally intended for use in library applications. MODS is a derivative of the MARC21 format (see Section 2.12), designed to be less detailed, more simple and more human readable with less abbreviations or coded values [54]. MODS offers 19 top-levelelements and several sub-elements. All elements except titleInfo are optional and all but recordInfo are repeatable . According to [34], MODS is intended to offer an alternative or complement between too simple metadata formats and too complex, feature-rich ones.</p>

                <head n="2.7">Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting</head>
                <p>The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) developed an interoperable standard for gathering, exchanging and processing metadata of publications scattered across many services or repositories [47, 60]. This standard is referred to as the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (or abbreviated as OAI-PMH).</p>
                <p>The protocol differentiates between Data Providers and Service Providers [47]. Data Providers provide the metadata and Service Providers use and process that data, for example for offering a search engine. It is possible to register as an official Data Provider [85] but there is no need to register in order to access data as a Service Provider. There is a list with all registered Data Providers available. 6 The protocol is based on HTTP Requests and XML.</p>
                <p>The request for data is send via a HTTP GET or POST request to the repository&apos;s web server, which then processes this request and responds with an XML output.</p>
                <p>The metadata format of the response can be chosen from a list of formats that the current repository has implemented . All repositories must at least implement the Dublin Core format (see Section 2.2). Further information can be found in the official protocol description [47] and the appended implementation guidelines. There is also a list available with existing tools for implementing an OAI-PMH interface. 7</p>
                <p>Listing 5 presents an exemplary OAI-PMH request that requests the metadata (in Dublin Core format) of a record with the given identifier and Listing 6 shows the corresponding response.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The DBLP XML format is a special XML format developed by the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography. It can be concisely described as BibTeX written in XML. Like BibTeX, a DBLP XML file consists of one or multiple entries. Each entry has an entry type and some tags associated. The entry types are the same as specified in BibTeX but limited to article, inproceedings, proceedings, book, incollection, phdthesis and masterthesis. As an addition, there is the entry type www which is not present in BibTeX and is used for author homepages. The tags are also the same but the only tag required is the title tag, all others are optional. Another difference is that in DBLP XML each author gets his own tag, sorted by the order of their appearance on the publication. Additionally there are tags for the last modification date, for the URL to the publisher&apos;s website and for the URL to the table of contents of the book or conference the entry is a part of. Finally, all entries have a unique key generated by a specific pattern, similar to the cite key known from BibTeX. Further information can be found in [49].</p>

                <p>A RIS file is a plain text file that contains one or multiple entries. Each entry consists of several fields, which are composed of a tag indicating the field type followed by two whitespaces, a single dash, another whitespace and finally the content of that field. Each field must be on a separate line. They can be in any order with the exception of the first field TY (the reference type, similar to BibTeX but with many more types) and the last field ER (end of reference). Authors&apos; names must be in the format Surname, Forename and every author gets his own AU field. Authors can also be represented as primary, secondary , etc., using A1, A2, A3, A4. A full list of all supported tags, reference types and other format specifications can be found in the format description [88]. Listing 8 shows an exemplary RIS entry. When a website offers export to the RIS format, sending the MIME type application/x-research-infosystems along with the exported data will automatically open up EndNote or ReferenceManager on the user&apos;s system and import it to the user&apos;s library [88]</p>

                <p>The Citation Style Language (CSL) is an open standard for describing the formatting and styling of citations in an XML-based format. It was initially created by Bruce D&apos;Arcus and is maintained by many contributors [96]. It offers about 7000 free crowdsources citation styles and is used by many commercial or open source projects. There are CSL processors (known as citeproc&apos;s) available for several programming languages. They can create correctly formatted citations from given publication metadata using the CSL styles. Citeproc-js, a well-known CSL processor for JavaScript, introduced a JSON 10 schema called CSL-JSON to handle the bibliographic metadata. It is not an official standard but it&apos;s 10 http://json.org/ used by other CSL tools, too. The schema is described on the CSL project&apos;s GitHub page. 11 The project&apos;s website [96] describes more details of CSL. Listing 9 presents an exemplary CSL-JSON entry.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>A digital object identifier (DOI) is used to identify an object unrelated to its current location and thus providing persistence when referencing to it [40]. Metadata and location can be stored together with the DOI but the identifier will remain fixed even when the data changes. That is why a DOI provides a great benefit when linking to publications. When the location of the document has changed and the location data of the identifier was updated accordingly, the linking via the DOI will stay valid. If a DOI was not used, all links to the publication would become invalid and would need to get updated with the new location of the document. The standardized DOI system is developed and controlled by the International DOI Foundation (IDF) [42].</p>

                <p>The EPrints repository software (see Section 4.2) has its own meta tag format and the Berkeley Electronic Press has developed the meta tag format BE Press Tags for its repository software (see Section 4.3). MARC21 is a meta data format designed for carrying bibliographic information [84]. Due to its numeric field names and coded values it is rather unintuitive and hard to read (see some examples 13 ). More information about the format can be found in [84]. CSV is the abbrevation for Comma-seperated values which is not really a bibliographic data format, but a widely used plain text format that can store tabular data. It can have any number of records separated by line breaks. Each line shares an often identical series of fields which are separated by a character, commonly the comma. YAML is a markup and data serialization language with high similarities to JSON (see CSL-JSON in Section 2.10) [11]. In fact JSON is a subset of YAML. The author of [31] suggests the usage of YAML together with CSL (see Section 2.10) because of the balance between human and machine readability.</p>

                <head n="2.13">Overview of Data Formats</head>
                <p>After introducing these formats and protocols it is now important to find out how widely each of them is used. As a reference, the usage of these formats by the bibliographic databases introduced in Section 3 has been con- sidered. Table 1 gives an overview of the formats that the bibliographic databases offer their users to export the metadata of publications. The user can import this exported data in his or her favorite software to create and manage citation lists or bibliographies. In this case BibTeX is by far the most frequently offered format, which perfectly makes sense since it is the most widely accepted bibliographic metadata format in general. Following at a distance is RIS and then some other formats. 13 http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/examples. html DOIs are also widely used among the examined databases. Almost all of them show and use the DOI to provide a permanent link to the full text document. It is also interesting to take a look at the import and export formats used on the backend of the databases. This will be further analyzed in Section 3.12 and Section 3.13 after the databases have been introduced.</p>

                <p>This section deals with several established bibliographic databases and search engines for scholarly publications which are most important for computer scientists. These services provide information to the users about publications , authors, journals or conferences and much more. Some also offer detailed statistics and visualizations about the data. Each of these services has been examined on how to add data to their index or collect data from them.</p>

                <head n="3.1">Google Scholar</head>
                <p>In 2004, Google released a search engine designed for scholarly publications called Google Scholar [32]. Beside the information on publications it provides author profiles and citation statistics. It also offers full-textindexing of the publications. Google Scholar uses a crawler to autonomously search the web for new data. The indexed data gets evaluated and ranked by computer algorithms. Google neither gives details about these algorithms nor any information on when this crawling happens or why it might have failed. But they have published detailed guidelines how the data should be presented to get added to the index successfully [33]. Google Scholar can index and extract information from PDF files and HTML pages [33]. Each page must contain the meta information of no more than one publication . They recommend to use HTML meta tags and support Highwire Press (see Section 2.3), Eprints, BE Press, PRISM and Dublin Core tags (see Section 2.2).</p>
                <p>The usage of Dublin Core tags is not recommended because they &quot;work poorly for journal papers&quot;. 14 Google uses Highwire Press tags in all its given examples. In addition to that or if there are no meta tags present, Google Scholar can also consider the structure of the HTML page or PDF file and its elements and thus try to identify the metadata. Every page or file of a website must be reachable from within a maximum of ten links down from the starting page. That is why larger databases are recommended to provide listings of all entries grouped</p>

                <p>CiteSeerX is a scientific literature search engine and database with focus on computer sciences. Its former version, CiteSeer, was first developed in 1997 but couldn&apos;t stand the extended tasks any longer after about ten years. It was then redeveloped and became Cite- SeerX [18]. CiteSeer was the first to provide autonomous citation indexing, what means that it automatically extracts and indexes citations from publications for better search results and for evaluational or statistical usage [48]. It also offers full-text-indexing of the publica- tions.</p>
                <p>CiteSeerX uses a focused crawler to get new data. This crawler doesn&apos;t search the whole web but only sites from a crawl list [16]. There is a form that allows to submit URL&apos;s for crawling, but it states it only searches for PDF files (and some other) to a depth of one [19]. There is no validation taking place to verify the content or the author of the found publications.</p>
                <p>The data from CiteSeerX is freely available for access via an OAI-PMH interface. The full data can also be downloaded, but this requires getting in further contact with the team of CiteSeerX [17].</p>
                <p>They also offer an extractor which is open source and can extract metadata and citations from documents and return it in several different formats, for example BibTeX or XML [15]</p>

In 2009 it contained more than 1.2 million indexed publications and about 700,000 authors. Today there are even more than 2.6 million publications listed [80]. A direct input of data into the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography is not possible for everyone [81]. The DBLP automatically indexes the table of contents of complete proceedings or journals provided by the major publishers. If there is no metadata provided, conference chairmen or journal editors can provide the metadata using the DBLP Submission format [82].</p>

                <p>Using crawlers to get data from the DBLP website is currently allowed, but there is a notice that &quot;this feature will change in the near future&quot; [79]. It is recommended to use the offered API. Whether crawling or API calling, the scripts should be able to react correctly to timeouts and must not perform a more than reasonable amount of data requests per minute. If a lot of data is needed, one is advised to use the complete XML file instead [79]</p>

But there are also much smaller author-, subject-or conference-specific databases that contribute. The data from these sources gets updated weekly [75, 78].</p>
                <p>The Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies offers the possibility to add own data via a direct input of single BibTeX entries which will then take a week to appear on the site [76]. Or one could add a whole new source collection if certain criteria are fulfilled. In order to do this, the bibliography needs to have a single compressed plain text file with a fixed name containing all data as BibTeX entries, accessible via HTTP or FTP. This file will then be mirrored and automatically kept upto-date . A submitted bibliography should cover either a specific subject area, a complete journal or conference or all publications of a specific institution or publisher [77]. There seems to be no way of getting or accessing data except just linking to it or manually downloading single BibTeX files. It is possible to become a mirror site that copies the whole collection, but this won&apos;t serve the purpose of accessing particular data.</p>

BASE 15 http://academic.research.microsoft.com/About/Help. htm#5 claims that it intellectually selects and evaluates these sources before indexing them. BASE is a registered Open Archives Initiative Service Provider (see Section 2.7) [8]. It is possible to suggest a new data source for inclusion if this source has a correctly implemented OAI-PMH interface providing the data [10], but if the source is a registered OAI Data Provider it should already be included [9]. BASE offers an OAI-PMH Validity Checker to verify if the OIA-PMH interface is working correctly. Besides that, the intellectual criteria used to select the sources are not really specified . The data from the selected sources gets updated every weekend [9]. BASE also provides access to its own data via a HTTP interface or an OAI-PMH interface that returns data in the Dublin Core format or an extended Dublin Core format with extra elements by BASE [8].

                <p>In 1991, arXiv started as xxx.lanl.gov, a server for exchanging and archiving articles about physics before they got printed [4]. Today it is maintained by the Cornell University Library and contains about 989,000 open access documents about physics, mathematics, computer sciences and other areas. Submitting single articles is only possible for registered authors which therefore have to grant arXiv the license to distribute their work [6].</p>

                <p>Founded in 2008 in Hannover and Boston, ResearchGate rather is a kind of social network for scientists than a pure bibliographic database [68]. It currently has about 67 million publications and more than 5 million members, which can collaborate together, share publications and get statistics about their work. The most important part of ResearchGate is its author profiles. ResearchGate is accessible for registered users only and the registration is free. According to [67], ResearchGate gets its publication and author data from other bibliographic databases, such as, in terms of computer sciences, CiteSeer (see Section 3.2). Additionally, registered users can upload publications to their profiles. There seems to be no way to access the data from ResearchGate.</p>

                <p>The ACM Digital Library is a bibliographic database that provides subscription based full text document access to all publications of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and access to bibliographic citations from other major publishers [7]. It offers analyzation of references and citations and exports metadata to BibTeX and EndNote. IEEE Xplore is a bibliographic database that provides access to more than 3 million publications on electrical engineering, computer science and electronics [39]. It mainly covers documents published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and its partners and offers a subscription model for accessing full text documents. IEEE Xplore also offers analyzation of references and citations and exports meta data to BibTeX and RIS. Web of Science (WoS) (former known as Web of Knowledge) is a subscription-based interdisciplinary bibliographic database from Thomson Reuters stating that it is &quot;the world&apos;s largest collection of research data&quot; and the &quot;only true citation index&quot; [86]. It also claims that it objectively evaluates and selects its data sources. It is possible to suggest a repository for indexing. More information on the selection process can be found in [87]. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is a database that indexes open access, peer-reviewed journals [28]. It states that it uses a quality control system for its content and offers a quite sophisticated application form for journal publishers. CiteULike is a bookmarking web-service for creating and sharing bibliographies [20]. It can import data from various sources (see [20] for a full list of currently supported sources) and allows the user to organize or share its bibliography with other users. CiteULike can also import BibTeX files and export the user&apos;s bibliography to BibTeX or RIS. BibSonomy is a bookmarking web-service for creating and sharing bibliographies [13]. It can import data from various sites. 16 It offers a great amount of export formats, including but not limited to BibTeX, CSL- JSON, EndNote, DBLP XML, RIS and several plain text citations.</p>

                <head n="3.12">Overview of Indexing Requirements</head>
                <p>After introducing these bibliographic databases, it is now important to summarize what to do in order to get publications indexed by the examined databases. Table 2 shows that there is a wide variety of ways to get publications indexed by the databases. Some offer Open Journal of Web Technologies (OJWT), Volume 1, Issue 2, 2014 Database How to get indexed Supported formats Google Scholar by getting crawled HTML Meta tags (Highwire, Dublin Core and others), HTML structure, PDF CiteSeerX by submitting a URL for crawling PDF BASE by being a OAI Data Provider or registering as a source OAI-PMH MAS by submitting single files (only registered users) or being indexed by one of the data sources PDF, BibTeX</p>
                <p>Arnetminer by being indexed by DBLP or getting crawled unknown DBLP only publishers or conference chairmen can submit data DBLP Submission Format CCSB by submitting single files, registering as a source or being indexed by one of the data sources BibTeX arXiv by submitting single files (only registered users) PDF, LaTeX ResearchGate by submitting single files (only registered users) or being indexed by one of the data sources BibTeX, RIS, MODS, DBLP- XML, PDF and others Mendeley by being indexed by one of the data sources or import button on website HTML Meta tags, PDF Table 2: How to get indexed by the databases automatic ways like getting crawled or offering an OAI- PMH interface, but most of them want a manually uploaded file or a submitted URL. If you are an individual author submitting single files may be sufficient for you, but if you own a repository with many publications the automatic ways are the most interesting ones. Another important factor to consider is the exchange of information that takes place between the databases. Almost all of the examined databases harvest data from other sources or distribute their own information to others . Figure 2 gives an overview of known relationships between the databases.</p>
                <figure>

                    <figDesc>Known relationships between the databases</figDesc>
                </figure>
                <p>Please note that although Figure 2 may create the impression that these are &quot;push&quot; operations, they really are &quot;pull&quot; operations instead. The databases do not actively distribute their data to others, their data is accessed by others. The three databases whose data is accessed most are CiteSeerX, arXiv and the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography . Unfortunately, getting CiteSeerX to index a lot of publications is a little bit difficult, because one has to manually submit a URL to every single PDF file to get crawled. And submitting publications to arXiv is still more difficult, as arXiv only accepts manual uploads of single PDF files. At least there is no need to take care of the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography if you are an author, because if your publication was published by a major publisher or is part of a big conference it should be already indexed. If not, you will most certainly not be able to change this.</p>
                <p>Getting indexed by these three databases should cover all other examined databases with the exception of Google Scholar. But it can be assumed that Google&apos;s crawler will catch the information from one of the other covered databases anyway. Also, it should be easy to get crawled by Google Scholar with adding the required meta tags to the publication pages and following their guidelines (see Section 3.1). As CiteSeerX and arXiv are registered OAI Data Providers, their data will be distributed among other OAI Service Providers. Unfortunately, BASE is the only officially registered OAI Service Provider of the examined databases, but there are others outside the scope of this paper. Providing an OAI-PMH interface may be a wise idea anyway, as it is a good way for others to get access to your data. So if you want a lot of publications to get indexed, a reasonable approach requiring the least manual effort would be to follow the guidelines of Google Scholar, provide an OAI-PMH interface, register as an official OAI Data Provider and maybe register as a data source for BASE and the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies . To cover everything you would need to find a way to automatically submit single URL&apos;s or files to the other databases.</p>

                <head n="3.13">Overview of Crawling Possibilities</head>
                <p>Another interesting aspect to summarize is how the data of the bibliographic databases can be accessed or harvested in order to embed their data into your repository. Table 3 gives an overview of how to access data. It shows that popular ways to offer access are to provide an API or an OAI-PMH interface. In general, only information and metadata of the publications are accessible, but Microsoft Academic Search is an exception because it provides the greatest amount of accessible information and also offers the possibility to easily embed data on your own website via JavaScript. Others, like for example Google Scholar or the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies, offer no way to access their data. Table 3 also shows that half of the examined databases disallow the crawling of their sites for information. When also taking into account the fact that developing a good crawler is not an easy task, crawling becomes an even less recommendable approach to access data from these bibliographic databases.</p>

It is designed to index and expose all publications of an institution. It allows to harvest metadata from OAI-compliant databases, perform changes or normalization on the harvested data and index the resulting information in order to expose it using a customizable user interface. It also offers browsing and has a simple or advanced search interface. It requires an Apache web server with PHP and MySQL or PostgreSQL installed. OHS is released under an open source license and is available for free. The Public Knowledge Project also offers Open Journal Systems (OJS) 17 , Open Conference Systems (OCS) 18 and Open Monograph Press (OMP) 19 which are designed to help managing a journal, conference or book production , to assist with the submission of manuscripts and the publishing process and to expose the publications to the web.</p>

EPrints offers a customizable user interface that allows browsing by subject, division, author and year and has a simple or advanced search function. It also shows download statistics and lists of most downloaded items or top authors [91]. Users can register for an account in order to save search results or add and edit own publications. When adding a new entry, duplicate avoidance is used and files can be uploaded. Each publication can have multiple associated files including images, audio or video. A publication page includes meta tags for Google Scholar, metadata of the publication, the abstract and contact information of the author. Publications or even whole publication lists can be exported to Dublin Core, Bib- TeX, EndNote, RIS, HTML, plain text or as a RSS feed. EPrints also provides an OAI-PMH interface for accessing data [91]. Furthermore, its own meta tags format can be directly crawled by Google Scholar.</p>

                <head n="5">FURTHER RELATED WORK</head>
                <p>Research in digital libraries is an active field. [43] addresses the challenges in digital library informationtechnology infrastructures. Besides the already described commercial or open source repository systems (see Section 4), some research prototypes like [61, 44] have been developed to maintain and manipulate bibliographies as well as to manage and share resources and knowledge. Also, [27] describes ways to optimize the visibilty of publications for search engine crawlers. Research was also done on extracting information from publications. [48] contains research results on extracting citation information, [50] on extracting researcher profiles and [95] describes the development of an information extractor for scholarly PDF documents. Much has been researched to utilize the OAI-PMH framework: Many publications like [25, 46, 92, 1, 53, 51, 64] deal with resource harvesting and further analysis of the data like co-authorship networks [71]. Other contributions like [26] show that OAI-PMH data providers can enhance their repository with simple user interfaces on top of the OAI-PMH interface. [70, 45] discuss the benefits of integrating different protocols and standards with OAI. Some contributions [14, 21, 69] describe the easy integration of different data sources like relational databases or data crawled from webpages in the OAI- PMH framework. [52] describes an implementation for OAI data/service provider of individuals as well as institutional repositories. [63, 55] demonstrate the relative effectiveness of a range of search tools (some of which utilize OAI as well) in finding open access versions of peer reviewed academic articles on the world wide web. [93, 94] analyze the problems occurring during the OAI data-provider registration and validation service process. [73] gives an overview over the developments and trends of the OAI protocol.</p>

                <head n="6">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</head>
                <p>This review provides an overview on popular data formats for exchanging bibliographic data about scientific publications in the computer science area. Furthermore, it analyzes bibliographic databases with special regard to their indexing requirements on one side and the possibilities to retrieve publication information from them on the other side. Finally we investigate personal and institutional research repository systems for their support to get their contained publications easily indexed by the previously described bibliographic databases. Hence this review helps authors and publishers to find ways to increase the visibility of their (published) research . This goal can be achieved by maximizing the inclusion of their publications in bibliographic databases, such that their contributions is easily found and cannot be overseen by other researchers. Future work covers the implementation of institutional repository systems especially designed for the maximum inclusion in bibliographic databases and the analysis and presentation of the data accessible from bibliographic databases in new forms. Besides obvious issues like the support of widely used data formats and protocols for inclusion in bibliographic databases we want to address special functionalities like the (semi-) automatic filling of web forms of some of these bibliographic databases, such that publications can be quickly registered. There could be first an automatic search in these databases to register only those publications which are still missing. On the other hand we want to investigate how to provide a statistics page with deeper analysis also on the level of an author or institutional repository system. For this purpose we want to include information from other bibliographic databases like the citations of publications, which are included in our developed repository system. Also a systematic and targeted search for those publications citing the publications included in our repository system is a promising new research direction.</p>
