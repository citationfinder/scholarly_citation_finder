                    <note>ABSTRACT Every author and publisher is interested in adding their publications to the widely used bibliographic databases freely accessible in the world wide web: This ensures the visibility of their publications and hence of the published research. However, the inclusion requirements of publications in the bibliographic databases are heterogeneous even on the technical side. This survey paper aims in shedding light on the various data formats, protocols and technical requirements of getting indexed by widely used bibliographic databases in the area of computer science and provides hints for maximal database inclusion. Furthermore, we point out the possibilities to utilize the data of bibliographic databases, and describes some personal and institutional research repository systems with special regard to the support of inclusion in bibliographic databases.

                <head> 2.1 BibTeX</head>
                <p> BibTeX was developed by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport for managing and formatting lists of refer- ences
                    <ref type="bibr" coords="2,331.45,249.93,15.27,8.91" target="#b64"> [65]</ref> . It is typically used together with L A T E X documents but can be used with other software and became a de facto standard to define references. The first release was in 1985 and the latest version is from 2010. A BibTeX file consists of a set of entries each of which represent a reference. There are currently 14 common entry types in BibTeX, for example book, article or incollection. Each of this entry type has required fields and some optional fields, where for example title and author are almost always required. Multiple authors should be separated with an and instead of commas. Further information can be found in the format description
                    <ref type="bibr" coords="2,353.25,393.39,15.77,8.91" target="#b28"> [29,</ref>

The generated output depends on the used citation style. The one shown here corresponds to the style ieeetrans. @article {kumu14:sample-pub, author = {Arne Kusserow and Max Mustermann}, title = {Researching Something Special}, journal = {Special Research Journal}, number = {1}, volume = {4}, pages = {15--21}, year = {2014}, month = {November} } Listing 1: BibTeX example

Mustermann, "Researching something special," Special Research Journal, vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 15-21, November 2014. Each entry must have a citation key, which is later used as a reference to this entry within the L A T E X doc-ument. This key must be unique within a BibTeX file and is ideally easy recognizable. When the L A T E X document is compiled, BibTeX generates the list of references from the given BibTeX entries using the template for a selected citation style. A BibTeX file is a plain text file that can be edited with any text editor, but there is also software (for example BibDesk 2 , JabRef 3 or Bibfilex 4 ) that can manage whole bibliographies in one big file, offering a graphical user interface, search and sort features and auto-generation of the citation keys following a predefined or user-defined pattern as well as managing associated PDF files or URLs.

This system is known as Dublin Core Metadata and was meant to allow the authors of websites to describe their content in a way it could be discovered by keyword-based search engines. Nowadays though most of the leading search engines ignore most of the metadata of websites because there was an extensive misuse and spamming with metadata in the past. Practical benefits of the use of metadata remain only in fields where the search engines can trust the data and thus consider it. That is why the Dublin Core Metadata, although originally conceived for all kinds of content, is now primarily used in the library world

But even there Google claims that "they work poorly for journal papers because Dublin Core doesn't have unambiguous fields for journal title, volume, issue, and page numbers". 5 Instead, a complete bibliographic citation including for example the journal, volume, issue and page numbers can and is recommended to be given in the bibliographicCitation field

Dublin Core Metadata can be presented in RDF/XML or embedded in the head section of HTML documents in &lt;meta&gt; tags. There are 15 core elements and some more additional elements in Dublin Core. All elements are optional , can be repeated and can be in any order. We refer the interested reader to the format description

                <p> PRISM is developed by the PRISM Metadata Initiative and was first released in 2001. The current version is 3.0 from 2012. It specifies an XML/RDF element set for storing and interchanging metadata that describes resources or their relationship to other resources and incorporates Dublin Core elements (see Section 2.2)

                <p> The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) developed an interoperable standard for gathering, exchanging and processing metadata of publications scattered across many services or repositories

There is a list with all registered Data Providers available. 6 The protocol is based on HTTP Requests and XML. The request for data is send via a HTTP GET or POST request to the repository's web server, which then processes this request and responds with an XML output. The metadata format of the response can be chosen from a list of formats that the current repository has implemented . All repositories must at least implement the Dublin Core format (see Section 2.2). Further information can be found in the official protocol description

                <p> The DBLP XML format is a special XML format developed by the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography. It can be concisely described as BibTeX written in XML. Like BibTeX, a DBLP XML file consists of one or multiple entries. Each entry has an entry type and some tags associated. The entry types are the same as specified in BibTeX but limited to article, inproceedings, proceedings, book, incollection, phdthesis and masterthesis. As an addition, there is the entry type www which is not present in BibTeX and is used for author homepages. The tags are also the same but the only tag required is the title tag, all others are optional. Another difference is that in DBLP XML each author gets his own tag, sorted by the order of their appearance on the publication. Additionally there are tags for the last modification date, for the URL to the publisher's website and for the URL to the table of contents of the book or conference the entry is a part of. Finally, all entries have a unique key generated by a specific pattern, similar to the cite key known from BibTeX. Further information can be found in

The DBLP Submission Format has high similarities with DBLP XML but is intended only for letting publishers submit metadata to the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography.

                <p> A RIS file is a plain text file that contains one or multiple entries. Each entry consists of several fields, which are composed of a tag indicating the field type followed by two whitespaces, a single dash, another whitespace and finally the content of that field. Each field must be on a separate line. They can be in any order with the exception of the first field TY (the reference type, similar to BibTeX but with many more types) and the last field ER (end of reference). Authors' names must be in the format Surname, Forename and every author gets his own AU field. Authors can also be represented as primary, secondary , etc., using A1, A2, A3, A4. A full list of all supported tags, reference types and other format specifications can be found in the format description

When a website offers export to the RIS format, sending the MIME type application/x-research-infosystems along with the exported data will automatically open up EndNote or ReferenceManager on the user's system and import it to the user's library

                <p> The Citation Style Language (CSL) is an open standard for describing the formatting and styling of citations in an XML-based format. It was initially created by Bruce D'Arcus and is maintained by many contributors

It offers about 7000 free crowdsources citation styles and is used by many commercial or open source projects. There are CSL processors (known as citeproc's) available for several programming languages. They can create correctly formatted citations from given publication metadata using the CSL styles. Citeproc-js, a well-known CSL processor for JavaScript, introduced a JSON 10 schema called CSL-JSON to handle the bibliographic metadata. It is not an official standard but it's 10 http://json.org/ used by other CSL tools, too. The schema is described on the CSL project's GitHub page. 11 The project's website

                <p> A digital object identifier (DOI) is used to identify an object unrelated to its current location and thus providing persistence when referencing to it
                    <ref type="bibr" coords="6,467.39,570.79,15.27,8.91" target="#b39"> [40]</ref>. Metadata and location can be stored together with the DOI but the identifier will remain fixed even when the data changes. That is why a DOI provides a great benefit when linking to publications. When the location of the document has changed and the location data of the identifier was updated accordingly, the linking via the DOI will stay valid. If a DOI was not used, all links to the publication would become invalid and would need to get updated with the new location of the document. The standardized DOI system is developed and controlled by the International DOI Foundation (IDF)

Several Registration Agencies 12 provide the necessary infrastructure for registering DOI names and maintaining the data. Each Registration Agency is allowed to offer its own business model, so the cost of registering new DOI's can vary. An example for prices can be seen in

                <p> The EPrints repository software (see Section 4.2) has its own meta tag format and the Berkeley Electronic Press has developed the meta tag format BE Press Tags for its repository software (see Section 4.3). MARC21 is a meta data format designed for carrying bibliographic information

CSV is the abbrevation for Comma-seperated values which is not really a bibliographic data format, but a widely used plain text format that can store tabular data. It can have any number of records separated by line breaks. Each line shares an often identical series of fields which are separated by a character, commonly the comma. YAML is a markup and data serialization language with high similarities to JSON (see CSL-JSON in Section 2.10)

                <p> After introducing these formats and protocols it is now important to find out how widely each of them is used. As a reference, the usage of these formats by the bibliographic databases introduced in Section 3 has been con- sidered.
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_1" coords="7,81.96,619.67,29.57,8.91">Table 1</ref> gives an overview of the formats that the bibliographic databases offer their users to export the metadata of publications. The user can import this exported data in his or her favorite software to create and manage citation lists or bibliographies. In this case BibTeX is by far the most frequently offered format, which perfectly makes sense since it is the most widely accepted bibliographic metadata format in general. Following at a distance is RIS and then some other formats. DOIs are also widely used among the examined databases. Almost all of them show and use the DOI to provide a permanent link to the full text document. It is also interesting to take a look at the import and export formats used on the backend of the databases. This will be further analyzed in Section 3.12 and Section 3.13 after the databases have been introduced.

                <p> In 2004, Google released a search engine designed for scholarly publications called Google Scholar
                    <ref type="bibr" coords="7,491.92,395.47,15.27,8.91" target="#b31"> [32]</ref> . Beside the information on publications it provides author profiles and citation statistics. It also offers full-textindexing of the publications. Google Scholar uses a crawler to autonomously search the web for new data. The indexed data gets evaluated and ranked by computer algorithms. Google neither gives details about these algorithms nor any information on when this crawling happens or why it might have failed. But they have published detailed guidelines how the data should be presented to get added to the index successfully
                    <ref type="bibr" coords="7,374.40,526.97,15.27,8.91" target="#b32"> [33]</ref>. Google Scholar can index and extract information from PDF files and HTML pages

They recommend to use HTML meta tags and support Highwire Press (see Section 2.3), Eprints, BE Press, PRISM and Dublin Core tags (see Section 2.2). The usage of Dublin Core tags is not recommended because they "work poorly for journal papers". 14 Google uses Highwire Press tags in all its given examples. In addition to that or if there are no meta tags present, Google Scholar can also consider the structure of the HTML page or PDF file and its elements and thus try to identify the metadata. Every page or file of a website must be reachable from within a maximum of ten links down from the starting page. That is why larger databases are recommended to provide listings of all entries grouped There seems to be no way of getting or accessing data from Google Scholar except just linking to it. Google does not offer an API nor interface to access its data.

Additionally, it integrates the publication data from existing online sources, in particular from the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography (see Section 3.3). There seems to be no way to input data directly. Arnetminer offers an API for searching or accessing data, even the author profiles can be accessed. When sending a request using a HTTP request, the server will answer with a formatted output of the data. It is possible to search for publications, conferences and experts on a subject by a keyword and for author profiles by name or id. Further information can be found in

                <head> 3.12 Overview of Indexing Requirements</head>
                <p> After introducing these bibliographic databases, it is now important to summarize what to do in order to get publications indexed by the examined databases.
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_2" coords="10,316.44,712.69,29.95,8.91">Table 2</ref> shows that there is a wide variety of ways to get publications indexed by the databases. Some offer Arnetminer by being indexed by DBLP or getting crawled unknown DBLP only publishers or conference chairmen can submit data DBLP Submission Format CCSB by submitting single files, registering as a source or being indexed by one of the data sources BibTeX arXiv by submitting single files (only registered users) PDF, LaTeX ResearchGate by submitting single files (only registered users) or being indexed by one of the data sources BibTeX, RIS, MODS, DBLP- XML, PDF and others Mendeley by being indexed by one of the data sources or import button on website HTML Meta tags, PDF
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_2" coords="11,205.68,328.34,30.08,8.96">Table 2</ref>: How to get indexed by the databases automatic ways like getting crawled or offering an OAI- PMH interface, but most of them want a manually uploaded file or a submitted URL. If you are an individual author submitting single files may be sufficient for you, but if you own a repository with many publications the automatic ways are the most interesting ones. Another important factor to consider is the exchange of information that takes place between the databases. Almost all of the examined databases harvest data from other sources or distribute their own information to oth- ers.
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2" coords="11,91.07,481.83,34.11,8.91">Figure 2</ref> gives an overview of known relationships between the databases. Please note that although
                    <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2" coords="11,185.14,721.78,33.68,8.91">Figure 2</ref> may create the impression that these are "push" operations, they really are "pull" operations instead. The databases do not actively distribute their data to others, their data is accessed by others. The three databases whose data is accessed most are CiteSeerX, arXiv and the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography . Unfortunately, getting CiteSeerX to index a lot of publications is a little bit difficult, because one has to manually submit a URL to every single PDF file to get crawled. And submitting publications to arXiv is still more difficult, as arXiv only accepts manual uploads of single PDF files. At least there is no need to take care of the DBLP Computer Science Bibliography if you are an author, because if your publication was published by a major publisher or is part of a big conference it should be already indexed. If not, you will most certainly not be able to change this. Getting indexed by these three databases should cover all other examined databases with the exception of Google Scholar. But it can be assumed that Google's crawler will catch the information from one of the other covered databases anyway. Also, it should be easy to get crawled by Google Scholar with adding the required meta tags to the publication pages and following their guidelines (see Section 3.1). As CiteSeerX and arXiv are registered OAI Data Providers, their data will be distributed among other OAI Service Providers. Unfortunately, BASE is the only officially registered OAI Service Provider of the examined databases, but there are others outside the scope of this paper. Providing an OAI-PMH interface may be a wise idea anyway, as it is a good way for others to get access to your data. So if you want a lot of publications to get indexed, a reasonable approach requiring the least manual effort would be to follow the guidelines of Google Scholar, provide an OAI-PMH interface, register as an official OAI Data Provider and maybe register as a data source for BASE and the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies . To cover everything you would need to find a way to automatically submit single URL's or files to the other databases.

                <p> Another interesting aspect to summarize is how the data of the bibliographic databases can be accessed or harvested in order to embed their data into your repository.
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3" coords="12,81.96,270.50,30.37,8.91">Table 3</ref> gives an overview of how to access data. It shows that popular ways to offer access are to provide an API or an OAI-PMH interface. In general, only information and metadata of the publications are accessible, but Microsoft Academic Search is an exception because it provides the greatest amount of accessible information and also offers the possibility to easily embed data on your own website via JavaScript. Others, like for example Google Scholar or the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies, offer no way to access their data.
                    <ref type="table" target="#tab_3" coords="12,81.96,390.84,29.01,8.91">Table 3</ref> also shows that half of the examined databases disallow the crawling of their sites for information. When also taking into account the fact that developing a good crawler is not an easy task, crawling becomes an even less recommendable approach to access data from these bibliographic databases.

                <p> This review provides an overview on popular data formats for exchanging bibliographic data about scientific publications in the computer science area. Furthermore, it analyzes bibliographic databases with special regard to their indexing requirements on one side and the possibilities to retrieve publication information from them on the other side. Finally we investigate personal and institutional research repository systems for their support to get their contained publications easily indexed by the previously described bibliographic databases. Hence this review helps authors and publishers to find ways to increase the visibility of their (published) re-search. This goal can be achieved by maximizing the inclusion of their publications in bibliographic databases, such that their contributions is easily found and cannot be overseen by other researchers. Future work covers the implementation of institutional repository systems especially designed for the maximum inclusion in bibliographic databases and the analysis and presentation of the data accessible from bibliographic databases in new forms. Besides obvious issues like the support of widely used data formats and protocols for inclusion in bibliographic databases we want to address special functionalities like the (semi-) automatic filling of web forms of some of these bibliographic databases, such that publications can be quickly registered. There could be first an automatic search in these databases to register only those publications which are still missing. On the other hand we want to investigate how to provide a statistics page with deeper analysis also on the level of an author or institutional repository system. For this purpose we want to include information from other bibliographic databases like the citations of publications, which are included in our developed repository system. Also a systematic and targeted search for those publications citing the publications included in our repository system is a promising new research direction. Arne Kusserow was born in Hildesheim, Germany in 1991. He currently studies Informatik (Computer Science) at the University of Lübeck and writes his bachelor thesis about Online Indexing of Scholarly Publications in which he also develops a web application for exposing scholarly publications to the web and to other bibliographic databases. in the European projects B2B-ECOM, MEMPHIS, ASG and TripCom. He was a member of the DAWG W3C Working Group, which developed SPARQL. He was the project leader of the DFG project LUPOSDATE, and is currently the project leader of two research projects, which research on FPGA acceleration of relational and Semantic Web databases. His research interests include Semantic Web, query and rule processing and optimization, Cloud Computing, peer-topeer (P2P) networks, Internet of Things, data visualization and visual query languages.</p>
